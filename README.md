 A program that opens a REPL to interact with your Racket file live, just like in the DrRacket development environment. The REPL allows you to use functions from your Racket file and interact with them live, which helps with testing and debugging.

I originally created this program for use in Yale's Introduction to Computer Science course, CPSC 201. Most students in the class used DrRacket because the integrated REPL was so convenient, but I found the IDE design to be ugly and inefficient, so I wanted to use Atom instead. However, Atom lacked a REPL. So instead of switching back to DrRacket, I installed a Terminal plugin for Atom and wrote this program, so I'd have all the functionality of DrRacket in a better environment.

The program worked well enough for me when I took the course. Since I find it unlikely that I'll ever program in Racket again, I've halted development.
